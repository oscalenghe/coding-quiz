## Coding Quiz



## Description

 I created a coding quiz to assess my progress in the class and as a way to study terms I have learned so far. The quiz is timed, and if answers are counted as incorrect, time is deducted from the timer. You receive a score at the end and have it added to a list of highscores and a separate page(WIP).

## Credits

Lots of refering to stackoverflow for this project, as well as compiling questions/answers from other quizzes online.

## License

See repository for licensing.
